November 2013: Added generated variables Births to HD/WF/OFUM (ER20458A-ER20458H), Region HD Grew Up (ER20377A), Head Geographic Mobility (ER20377B), K-6 Distress Scale (ER19833A). Also added Calls for Iw (ER17005B), and Iw Length (ER17005C). For this release we have also updated some of the KL background variables that were not ready at the time of the original 2001 release. On release 3, we are suppressing some additional variables to protect the anonymity of our respondents.  February 2014:  For Release 4 we have added one new coded variable in the philanthropy section (ER20081A) and Collapsed Beale (ER20377C). Additionally, we have corrected extant T-2 variables for a handful of cases.  January 2016: For Release 5 we have corrected the bottom code for H14/H38 (ER19709/ER19817) and H17/H41 (ER19712/ER19820) for both Head and Wife/""Wife"" where 1 means one cigarette or fewer per day.
