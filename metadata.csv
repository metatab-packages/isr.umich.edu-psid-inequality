Individuals associated with families from the Latino and Immigrant samples, added to the PSID in 1990/1992 and 1997/1999, and 2017 respectively, were assigned 1968 IDs so that they, too, have unique identifiers compatible with the PSID structure for the core (SRC and Census) sample.",,

Variable ER16518 has been recalculated.  Variable ER16519, a family cross-sectional weight, has been added.  November 2013: Added generated variables such as Family Composition Change (ER13008A), Births to HD/WF/OFUM (ER16517A-ER16517H), Region where HD grew up (ER16431A), HD Geographic Mobility (ER16431B), Interview length (ER13005B), mode of interview (ER13005C), and calls for interview (ER13005D).

Corrected data for Beale Rural-Urban Code (ER16431) although this variable will now be suppressed on the public release file.  February 2014: For Release 6 we have added one new variable Collapsed Beale (ER16431C).  Additionally we have completed contingency corrections for a handful of cases for the family level T-2 variables  ER16221-ER16223  ER16230-ER16245 after further cleaning of corresponding individual level T-2 variables.  January 2016: For Release 7 we have added one new variable Splitoff Indicator (ER13005E). Additionally we have corrected the top code values for A20 and A21 (ER13041 and ER13042) to match the codebook description. We have corrected the bottom code for H14/H38 (ER15544/ER15652) and H17/H41 (ER15547/ER15655) for both Head and Wife/""Wife"" where 1 means one cigarette or fewer per day.  November 2017: For Release 8, we have added 25 generated food security variables (ER14331A-ER14331Y). The food security variables were put through the same imputation and calculation process as was completed on the 2015 data to produce food security scale score and category. We have also added the aggregated consumption variables (ER16515A1-ER16515D6). These variables were previously released on a supplemental file.",,

Table.Column,er77599,number,2019,COMPLETED ED-RP,EDUCATION,"Reference Person's Completed Education Level:  Values in the range 1-16 represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 8 indicates that the Reference Person completed the eighth grade.     Values were computed as follows:  If it is not known whether Reference Person attended college (ER76919=8 or 9) or the number of years of college is unknown (ER76922=8 or 9), then the value is 99.  Otherwise, if Reference Person attended college (ER76919=1), then the value is 12 plus the number of years of college attended (ER76922).  Otherwise, if Reference Person did not attend college, (ER76919=5), the values are as follows:   (a) if Reference Person is a high school graduate (ER76908=1), the value is 12;   (b) if Reference Person received a GED (ER76908=2), the value is the last grade finished (ER76911);   (c) if Reference Person neither graduated from high school nor got a GED (ER76908=3), the value is the last grade finished (ER76916);   (d) if it is not known whether Reference Person graduated from high school, got a GED, or neither (ER76908=8 or 9), then the value is 99.  Education is asked only when the FU acquires a new Reference Person/Spouse/Partner. In cases where the Reference Person has retained the same designation of Reference Person/Spouse/Partner from the previous interview (ER76856=5), this variable has been carried forward from previous years' data. If Reference Person/Spouse/Partner reports updated education and it is higher than previously reported, then this variable is updated. Education was reasked of all Reference Persons in 1985 and 2009 and, as of 2015, all returning Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners are asked for an updated education report every wave. Please refer to variable Year Highest Education was Updated-Reference Person (ER76906) for recency of updated education information.  This variable differs from the individual level variable ER34752 in the treatment of Reference Persons who received a GED but did not attend college. The family-level variable value for such Reference Persons is the grade completed; for the individual-level variable, the value is 12.",,
Table.Column,er34752,integer,2019,YEARS COMPLETED EDUCATION             19,EDUCATION,"What is the highest grade or year of school that (you/he/she) has completed?:  This variable contains values for Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners and OFUMs aged 16 years or older who were in the Family Unit in the prior year.  The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 08 indicates that this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 2019 interview.   The values for 2019 Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners are pulled from 2019 family-level data. Beginning in the 2013 Wave, we asked for an education update for our returning Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners. If additional educational attainment was reported, we updated their education variables in the background section and reported the year of the education update on the Family file (see variables ""Year Highest Education Updated"", ER76761, for Spouses/Partners, and ER76906, for Reference Persons).  The values for 2019 OFUMs are derived as follows:  for new Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners/eligible OFUMS: uses variables that correspond to the main education series (KL43/G88a - KL61b/G88m);  for returning Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners/eligible OFUMs:  uses variables that correspond to the updated education series (KL74/G88n - KL83b/G88bb).  These data are parallel as of the 2015 Wave.  This variable differs from the family-level variables ER77599 (Reference Person) and ER77600 (Spouse/Partner) in the treatment of Reference Persons and Spouses/Partners who received a GED but did not attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the grade completed; for this individual-level variable, the value is 12. Similarly, for OFUMs, this variable differs from G88c1 (ER34722) in the treatment of OFUMs who received a GED (G88b1=2) but the value derived from G88c1 is less than 12 years;  that is, G88c1 retains the grade completed but the value for this variable is coded as 12.",,
