The combination of this variable and Person Number (ER30002) provides unique identification for each individual on the data file. Individuals associated with families from the Latino and Immigrant samples, added to the PSID in 1990/1992 and 1997/1999, and 2017 respectively, were assigned 1968 IDs so that they, too, have unique identifiers compatible with the PSID structure for the core (SRC and Census) sample.",,

Variable ER16518 has been recalculated.  Variable ER16519, a family cross-sectional weight, has been added.  November 2013: Added generated variables such as Family Composition Change (ER13008A), Births to HD/WF/OFUM (ER16517A-ER16517H), Region where HD grew up (ER16431A), HD Geographic Mobility (ER16431B), Interview length (ER13005B), mode of interview (ER13005C), and calls for interview (ER13005D). Also we have brought forward the background section for old Heads and Wives in section KL. Corrected data for Beale Rural-Urban Code (ER16431) although this variable will now be suppressed on the public release file.  February 2014: For Release 6 we have added one new variable Collapsed Beale (ER16431C).  Additionally we have completed contingency corrections for a handful of cases for the family level T-2 variables  ER16221-ER16223  ER16230-ER16245 after further cleaning of corresponding individual level T-2 variables.  January 2016: For Release 7 we have added one new variable Splitoff Indicator (ER13005E). Additionally we have corrected the top code values for A20 and A21 (ER13041 and ER13042) to match the codebook description. We have corrected the bottom code for H14/H38 (ER15544/ER15652) and H17/H41 (ER15547/ER15655) for both Head and Wife/""Wife"" where 1 means one cigarette or fewer per day.  November 2017: For Release 8, we have added 25 generated food security variables (ER14331A-ER14331Y). The food security variables were put through the same imputation and calculation process as was completed on the 2015 data to produce food security scale score and category. We have also added the aggregated consumption variables (ER16515A1-ER16515D6). These variables were previously released on a supplemental file.",,

Otherwise, if Reference Person attended college (ER76919=1), then the value is 12 plus the number of years of college attended (ER76922).  Otherwise, if Reference Person did not attend college, (ER76919=5), the values are as follows:   (a) if Reference Person is a high school graduate (ER76908=1), the value is 12;   (b) if Reference Person received a GED (ER76908=2), the value is the last grade finished (ER76911);   (c) if Reference Person neither graduated from high school nor got a GED (ER76908=3), the value is the last grade finished (ER76916);   (d) if it is not known whether Reference Person graduated from high school, got a GED, or neither (ER76908=8 or 9), then the value is 99.

Beginning in the 2013 Wave, we asked for an education update for our returning Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners.
